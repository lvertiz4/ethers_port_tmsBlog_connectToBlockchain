# Porting TMS-DEV blog on Connecting to the Ethereum Network using Ethers Library

Inspired by TMS DEV Blog's wonderful tutorials on using Rust to interact with the Ethereum network, I decided to port one of his keystone tutorials using the Ethers library, rather than the web3 library that he used to connect to Ethereum.

To make this work, be sure to correct a .env file to include values to import for your Ethereum JSON RPC connection, and a value to hold an account with test ether. In my tutorial, I connected to the Goerli testnet.
